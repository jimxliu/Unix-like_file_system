# Unix-like_file_system

This is a class project of my Operating Systems course, which is aimed to design and implement a simple file system in C. The FS structure in my implementation is similar to UFS, with inodes having direct, indirect and double indirect blocks for file content. The functions in this file system include file system formatting, mounting/unmounting, creating a file/directory, opening/closing a file, writing to/reading from a file, removing a file/directory, moving a file/directory to another location, as well as creating hard links to a file or directory.
